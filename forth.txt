What is Forth?

How does Forth work?

    Forth is essentially broken up into 2 parts:
        - A VIRTUAL MACHENE that itterates over an array of code pointers.
        - A "SHELL" that interprits text into an array of code pointers.
    
    A normal forth program will follow this diagram
    
    "string" -> shell -> {array} -> forth_vm
